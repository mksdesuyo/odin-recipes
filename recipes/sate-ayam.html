      A traditional and easily found dish in Indonesia is Sate Ayam, which
      consists of grilled chicken skewers served with peanut sauce. The term
      ‘Sate’ is believed to have originated from the Tamil word ‘catai’, meaning
      ‘flesh’, suggesting that Javanese street vendors developed this dish as an
      adaptation of Indian kebabs. In West Sumatra, a popular variant called
      Sate Padang features grilled beef skewers served with a distinctive spicy
      Minang sauce. Sate Ayam is simple to prepare, with all ingredients readily
      available at your local store.
