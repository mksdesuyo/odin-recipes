      Nasi Goreng, literally meaning ‘fried rice’, is a highly versatile
      Indonesian dish with roots in Southern Chinese culture. It primarily
      consists of seasoned rice stir-fried with meat and vegetables, originally
      created as a way to use leftover rice. The exact timeline of when
      Indonesians adopted and modified Chinese fried rice into their own Nasi
      Goreng is unclear, but it is believed to have occurred around the 10th
      century during the flourishing trade between Indonesia and China under
      Sriwijaya’s reign. Today, nearly every region in Indonesia has its unique
      version of Nasi Goreng, such as Nasi Goreng Jawa, Nasi Goreng Aceh, and
      Nasi Goreng Padang. This beloved dish can be found on almost every street
      corner. Due to its versatility, if you have trouble finding certain
      ingredients, you can easily adapt the recipe with alternatives that suit
      your taste and are readily available.
