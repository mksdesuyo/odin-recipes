      Martabak, originating from a Middle Eastern recipe of the same name, are
      savory snacks enjoyed in Indonesia. Essentially, it's a spicy omelet
      pancake filled with vegetables and minced meat, readily available from
      street vendors after sunset. Regions like Palembang, known for Martabak
      HAR, and Aceh, with Martabak Aceh, have their unique versions of this
      dish. Additionally, there's a sweeter variant known as Martabak Manis
      (called ‘Kue Terang Bulan’ in regions like Malang), which is a large
      pancake stuffed with toppings such as chocolate, cheese, and peanuts.
      Though it might seem complex, Martabak is actually quite simple to make,
      with ingredients easily found in local shops.
