      Bakso, a popular comfort food in Indonesia, is found everywhere from
      street vendors to luxury hotels and upscale restaurants. This dish
      consists of brothy meatballs typically served with noodles, chili paste,
      and spring onions. But that's not all – Bakso is as adaptable as Nasi
      Goreng, with numerous preparation methods all centered around meatballs
      and broth. Its name comes from the Hokkien term bak-so (肉酥, Pe̍h-ōe-jī:
      bah-so·), meaning "fluffy meat" or "minced meat", reflecting its Chinese
      culinary origins. Like Nasi Goreng, the exact timeline of how this Chinese
      meatball soup became a staple in Indonesian cuisine remains unclear.
      <br /><br />
      Different regions in Indonesia have their unique takes on Bakso. For
      instance, Bandung is known for ‘bakso cuanki’ (meatballs made with starch
      flour), while Malang is famous for ‘bakso bakar’ (grilled meatballs with
      broth). Despite these variations, Bakso remains a simple and versatile
      comfort food you can easily prepare at home during this stay-at-home
      period.
